//                If they do, ask for the exam score and repeat the process until they say no.
//                Make sure that their answer is case insensitive
//                (e.g.they can say Yes or yes and your code treats it the same).
//Once they say no, calculate the average of all of the exam scores based upon
//your accumulator and your counting variable.
//Make sure that you use some sort of a While Loop, an accumulating variable
//(to keep track of the total exam scores), 
//and a counting variable(to keep track of the number of scores they entered).
